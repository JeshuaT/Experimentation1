    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1. Extract substring\n",
    ": Take the following Python code that stores a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'\n",
    "\n",
    "Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2. Understanding string methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the documentation of the string methods at https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate optional arguments. So sub is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, then end is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3. Create a looping text\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapt the program you wrote in the previous chapter to present a moving text of 40 characters long that runs like a circle from left to right: when characters reach the end they starts to appear at the beginning again. Let the loop run from 1 to 80 so you can present a full circle.\n"
