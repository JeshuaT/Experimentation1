    "### Exercise 1. Print welcome text\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter your name: Chuck\n",
    "Hello Chuck\n",

    "Enter Hours: 35\n",
    "Enter Rate: 2.75\n",
    "Pay: 96.25\n",
    "We wonâ€™t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.\n",
