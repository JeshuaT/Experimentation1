    "### Exercise 6. Combine reaction time and accuracy information\n",
    " Write a program which prompts the user for a certain average reaction time value in milliseconds (between 1 and 2000 ms) and an average accuracy score (as proportion correct scores, ranging from 0 to 1). Combine these measure to a single score called the inverse accuracy score.\n",

    "> To deal with the issue of how to combine speed and error, Townsend and Ashby (1978) proposed the “inverse efficiency score” (IES; see also Townsend & Ashby, 1983). IES can be thought of as an observable measure that gauges the average energy consumed by the system over time (or the power of the system; Townsend & Ashby, 1983, p. 204). It consists of RT divided by 1 - PE (or by PC, the proportion of correct responses). So, for a given participant the mean (or median) RT of the correct responses in a particular condition is calculated and divided by (1-PE) or by PC. Since RTs are expressed in ms and divided by proportions, IES is expressed in ms as well. For instance, if a participant in a particular condition responds with an average RT of 652 ms and makes 5% errors, then IES = 652/(1-.05) = 652/.95 = 686 ms.\n",
