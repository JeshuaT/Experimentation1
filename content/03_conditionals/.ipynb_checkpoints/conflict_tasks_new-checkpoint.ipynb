    "## Creating the Stroop task\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a look at OpenSesame, we will first create one of the simplest and most famous psychology experiments, the Stroop task. This demonstrates the automaticity of reading as identifying the font colour of a congruent word (e.g. blue) is faster than identifying the font colour of an incongruent word (e.g. blue). When the word and colour are incongruent, the interference causes a delay in identifying the colour of the font. We will create a single block of trials to demonstrate the task. As you go through the guide, I recommend **saving your experiment every time you reach a new sub-heading** like the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a new experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open OpenSesame on your computer, you should get a window that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/image24.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you start an experiment, there are some templates that you can use. We are going to use the default template as we are going to make a single block of trials from scratch to demonstrate the building blocks of OpenSesame. Once you click on this, a new screen will appear and you will be able to change any of the general properties of the task. It is a good idea to give your experiment an informative name. You can do this by clicking where it says New experiment in blue, and editing the text. Press the return key to save the new name. Make sure you change the resolution to your monitor’s dimensions. If you are not sure what the resolution of your monitor is, you can look in the display settings of your computer. Once you have changed these, the general properties window should look like this:\n",

    " ![](images/image44.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few settings to explain here. Foreground and background refers to the colour of the screen and the elements displayed on it. We will keep the background black so the participant does not have to look at a dazzling white screen, and the foreground white to make it easy to read on a black background. I would also recommend increasing the default size of the font to 32, as 18 is too small to read and it saves you changing it every time you create a new component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The building blocks of creating an experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before making the Stroop task, we will go over some of the basics of structuring an experiment in OpenSesame. The design of your experiment will be shown in the Overview window, and it is displayed sequentially down the screen from the components at the start of the experiment to the components at the end of the experiment. The backbone of an experiment is created through loop and sequence components. A loop component  ![](images/image45.png) repeats what is inside it and defines any variables to use. A sequence component  ![](images/image1.png) contains other components such as a screen showing text that make up a single trial. Therefore, you would place a sequence component within a loop component to control how many times the sequence is repeated. Drag a loop component  ![](images/image45.png)and place it after welcome in the overview window, and drag a sequence component  ![](images/image1.png) and place it inside the loop. When you release the sequence, it will ask whether you want it placing into the loop or after the loop. Press into the loop and make sure they are both given informative names such as block_loop for the loop component and trial_sequence for the sequence component. For the names of components, there are a number of rules you need to follow. They cannot start with numbers, and you cannot include any spaces. If you need spaces to make it easier to read, use an underscore. You should now have a window that looks like this:  \n",
    "![](images/image19.png) \n",
    "Therefore, once we define our variables later, trial_sequence and everything in it will repeat for however many times you specify in block_loop. We will now create a single trial within trial_sequence. In most psychology experiments, you include a fixation cross to start a trial and focus the participant’s attention in the location where you will be presenting the stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the fixation dot\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be created using a sketchpad component\n",
    " ![](images/image82.png).\n",
    "This is a very flexible component where you can present text, shapes, and images. The sketchpad window has a list of elements on the left hand side and a black screen with green lines to show where on the screen the elements would be placed. OpenSesame has a very handy fixation cross element called fixdot\n",
    " ![](images/image20.png).\n",
    "Click on the fixdot element and this will turn your mouse into a pen icon. If you move the mouse around the black gridded screen, the coordinates are shown in the top right corner, and will change as you move around the screen. Place the fixdot element at 0,0 in the middle of the screen where the two green lines meet. This will place the fixdot in that position. There are two more things to change. Firstly, we can modify how long the stimuli are presented for by changing Duration. The default is keypress which would mean the screen will not disappear until the participant presses a button. We can change this to 500 to make the screen disappear after 500ms. Whenever you specify a duration in OpenSesame, it is stated in milliseconds. Therefore, to present something for 1 second, we would need to write 1000. Finally, we can change the name of the component to something informative such as fixation. You should now have a screen that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the word component\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Stroop task, participants are shown colour words and the font is either the same colour as the word (congruent) or a different colour to the word (incongruent). Therefore, the next thing we need to do is create another sketchpad component  ![](images/image82.png) to present the words. Drag a sketchpad component and place it after fixation in the trial sequence. Name it word to keep track of all the components. This time instead of inserting a fixation cross, we need a text element  ![](images/image15.png). After you have selected the text element, change the colour to green (all lowercase, it will say white by default). This will turn your mouse into a pen, and you need to click in the middle of the screen at 0,0 again to place it. When you click, it will ask you to enter some text. For now, just enter ‘Green’ as we want to show the participants colour words. This time, change Duration to 0. This does not mean that we never want it appearing on the screen, but we want it to only remain on the screen until a participant makes a response, which will require the next component keyboard_response. For the word component, you should have a window that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image78.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the keyboard response component\n",
    "\n",
    "The next component is keyboard_response  ![](images/image2.png). Drag this from the menu and place it after word. We need this to tell OpenSesame which keyboard responses are allowed and which responses are correct. For now, we only have one green word, so the only response we need is ‘g’. If you are ever unsure of what the valid name of the key you need is, click on List available keys. We will not specify a correct response yet. We can leave Timeout to infinite, so the word will remain on the screen until the participant presses ‘g’ on the keyboard. As we set the duration of the word component to 0, the amount of time it is presented for is determined by keyboard_response. A keyboard response component does not display on the screen, so it keeps the display from the previous sketchpad component. A common mistake is to set a time for both components. This would not allow you to record any response until the Duration of the word component has ended. This could really confuse participants as they would have to respond twice for the trial to end. You should now have a screen that looks like this for keyboard_response:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image72.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a blank screen\n",
    "\n",
    "After the keyboard response, we will place another sketchpad component  ![](images/image82.png) to signal the end of the trial. This time it will just be a blank screen presented for 200ms. You can do this yourself based on the previous sketchpad components and name it blank. We do not need to add any text or fixdot elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the logger component\n",
    "\n",
    "The next component that we need is a logger  ![](images/image81.png) to save the data. OpenSesame does not save the responses by default, so you need to create a logger to save the data from each trial. Drag a logger component and place it after blank. For most experiments, you can just keep the default option here. It just saves every available variable on each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the end of experiment screen\n",
    "\n",
    "The final component we need is a screen to tell the participant the experiment has finished. Without this, the experiment just closes which can make the participant panic and think they have done something wrong. Create a new sketchpad component  ![](images/image82.png) called end_experiment and place it after block_loop. Make sure it is not in trial_sequence. If you drop it on block_loop, you can select insert after block_loop. Here we just need a brief message saying ‘The experiment has now finished. Press any key to exit’. In order to create this, select a text element  ![](images/image15.png) , click in the middle of the screen, and enter the message. Now the participant is fully aware that the experiment has finished successfully. Make sure Duration is set to keypress. You should now have an experiment that looks like this in the Overview window:  \n",
    "![](images/image67.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying the welcome message\n",
    "\n",
    "The final thing to do before we test whether the experiment works is to change welcome. By default, this lists the version of OpenSesame that you are using. You can edit the pre-existing text by hovering over the text until it turns a light grey colour, and double-clicking. Change the text to something like ‘Welcome to the experiment, press any key to begin.’. We will make this more informative later on, but for now, this will do. All that matters is this sketchpad component has a keypress duration, as we want the participant to start the experiment when they are ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time to test the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time to make sure everything works! In the menu, there are three arrow buttons.  ![](images/image71.png) If you were collecting data from a participant, you would press the big green triangle to run the experiment full screen. The two green triangles runs the experiment in a separate window. The two blue triangles allow you to quickly run the experiment in a separate screen to make sure everything is working. It is usually a good idea to test your experiment using quick run, as if your experiment crashes, you can force it to quit. If you click quick run, your experiment should successfully run in a small window. If it does not run, look back at all of the instructions and make sure you have not made any typos, and all the components are where they should be. Remember to press ‘g’ to indicate the color is green. We only have one trial up to yet, so it will only last around one second. However, it is helpful to keep testing an experiment to make sure it works before you add something else. It makes it much easier to debug your experiment if you know it worked previously. This means you only need to investigate the changes you have made since it last worked. Your sanity will thank you if you make incremental changes, saving and running the experiment after every addition. Now that we know one trial works, we can add in multiple words and make the colour of the word change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manipulating the presentation of word and colour\n",
    "\n",
    "When we created the word component, we specified green as the word and colour. For the Stroop task, we want different words and colours depending on the condition. Therefore, we need to make both the word and colour variable for each trial. We need to do this in two steps. Firstly, we need to specify our conditions in block_loop (remember this is where we define our variables and control how many times sequence runs). We then need to change word to allow the word and colour to change every trial. We will start with block_loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editing the block_loop component\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on block_loop, it looks like an Excel sheet with lots of cells. This is where we can define our variables and conditions. The rules here are every column is a variable, and each row is an individual condition. The variables must have unique names, so you cannot repeat a variable name in the same or a different loop component. The first column will be called ‘empty_column’ by default. We will change this to ‘word’. We will change the second column to ‘colour’. It makes it easier if you use lower case letters as the variable names are case sensitive. We then need to populate the cells. We will have four words and colours: red, blue, yellow, and green. We want there to be some congruent and incongruent trials, so write each colour twice in the word column. In the colour column, we will pair red with blue, and yellow with green. So for each word, you should have one congruent colour and one incongruent colour. The grid should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image30.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need some additional variables that will be helpful for analysing the data later. We need a column called ‘congruent’ and a column called ‘correct_resp’. In the congruent column, write a 1 for every time the word and colour match, and a 0 for every time they do not match. In programming, 1 usually means true and 0 usually means false. This means that when we get the data afterwards, we can sort the responses by congruency and calculate whether the reaction times are longer in the incongruent condition. We also need to specify what is the correct response in order to use it in keyboard_response. In the correct_resp column, write the first letter of the colour variable for that row, e.g. r for red. You should now have a full grid like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image18.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create 8 trials, one for each row. Remember how it is the loop components that determine how many times the sequence component repeats. In other words, for every loop around trial_sequence, it will use one of these rows. Our next task is to edit the word component to use these new variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editing the word component\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on the word component, Green is still in the middle of the screen with green font. We need to click on the settings icon  ![](images/image6.png) in the top right corner and click on view script. We need to change two things here: the color and text arguments. At the moment, these are static and just present Green every time the component is called. OpenSesame lets you specify arguments using variables defined in a loop by entering the variable name surrounded by square brackets. For color, you should change it to say color = \\[colour\\]. This means that every time the component is called, the colour of the word will be determined by the colour variable in block_loop. We can then do the same for word and make sure it says text = \\[word\\]. Be very careful with your typing here as the variables are case sensitive. It should be typed exactly as it is in block_loop. One of the biggest causes of experiments not working is typos. You need an eagle eye to spot where you have made a mistake. The script should now look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image79.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on apply and close in the top right corner and we can move on to keyboard_response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editing keyboard_response\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now specify what variable determines a Correct response and enter several Allowed responses. In block_loop, we created a variable called correct_resp to tell OpenSesame what response should be provided. We need to use the same trick as in the script for word and enter ‘\\[correct_resp\\]’ to tell OpenSesame it should look for a variable. We then need to specify the four different responses that are allowed (g; r; b; y) in the Allowed responses box. It is important that the letters are separated by a semicolon and not a comma. After this, you should have a window that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image29.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now test it works again using quick run. It should run for 8 trials providing you have followed all the instructions closely. If you get an error message, use the instructions to try and locate the problem. It will probably be a stray typo in one of the variable names you have entered, so make sure it is all typed out exactly as in the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increase the number of trials\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know everything works fine, we can scale the experiment up to provide more trials. If we go back to block_loop, we can change the Repeat value to 4. This repeats all of our conditions 4 times to produce 32 trials. You will find that cognitive tasks repeat stimuli many times and take the average. We could specify all 32 trials in the block_loop grid, but doing it like this is much more efficient. One of the important settings to highlight now is Order. The default is random, which mixes our 8 rows up every time we run the experiment. This is usually the setting you will use as randomising the order helps to avoid presentation order being a confounding variable. The alternative is sequential. This calls the conditions in the exact order that you wrote them in. This can occasionally be useful if the order of presentation *is* important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run the experiment full screen\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time to run the experiment in full screen (the single green arrow) and enter a subject number. In other places, this could be called a participant number or code, but they mean the same thing. It is just the method you are using to label each participant. When you run an experiment, you will need to label all of your participants. OpenSesame asks you to provide a number, and then asks you to specify where you want to save the file. Make sure you create an easily identifiable folder to store your data. When it comes to saving the file, it is better to name your file clearly with a three digit participant number, e.g. stroop-001. This makes it easier to find and organise the file later, and creating a three digit code helps with ordering the files. Click save and run all 32 trials. We will now take a look at the data to see how we could analyse it.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Processing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do any analysis, it is important to process the data. Conventionally, we remove any incorrect responses as they may be unreliable. In addition, we should ensure that there are no problematic outliers. In the simplest case, there are response times that can be considered too fast or too slow. Anything below 100-200ms is unlikely to be a real response to the stimulus, as there is not enough time for the participant to perceive the stimulus and make a response. Conversely, response times above 1000-2000ms can be considered too slow and the participant may have been distracted. Response times on simple tasks are usually in the range of 400-700ms. A range of values at each end of the threshold have been presented as there is no one solution. It is important to read articles similar to the study you are conducting to see what they have done and justify your own decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next step in the outlier removal procedure, some studies will remove response times above and below certain thresholds to ensure the response times are approximately normally distributed. The most common of these is two or three standard deviations above and below the mean (Lachaud and Renaud, 2011). Despite being commonly used, there is good reason not to do this including being biased by the very outliers they are trying to remove (Leys et al., 2013). If you are interested in using a more robust outlier removal method, Leys et al. (2013) present an alternative using the absolute median deviation. As the outlier removal method differs between studies and topic, in this guide we will just focus on removing incorrect responses, and response times below 100ms and above 1000ms. When it comes to designing your own studies, you will need to look more closely at these articles and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying extreme responses\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to process the data, we will do it in two steps. The first is to create a new variable that defines any outliers beyond 100ms and 1000ms. On the main menu, click on Transform \\> Recode into Different Variables. Drag response_time into the white box, and type a new Output Variable Name called something like ‘extreme_responses’ and click Change. You should now have a screen that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image73.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now click on Old and New Values. This allows us to recode response_time into several values by specifying individual values, or a range of values. Our acceptable response times are 100-1000ms, so we will define three ranges for new values. 1) Click on Range and enter 100 in the first white box and 1000 in the second white box. We then need to specify a New Value for these responses. These are acceptable, so we can code them as 0. Finally click Add, and they will appear in the Old --\\> New box. Now we want to specify our extreme responses. 2) Click on Range, LOWEST through value and enter 99. This means we are taking the range from the lowest value in response_time to 99, as above 100ms is OK. Select a New Value of 1, and click Add. 3) Click on Range, value through HIGHEST, and specify 1001. Select a New Value of 1, and click Add. You should have a window looking like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image60.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click Continue and OK, and SPSS will create a new column called extreme_responses. Any row with a 0 is fine, and any with a 1 is outside of our boundary and considered an extreme response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering out extreme and incorrect responses\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now get SPSS to ignore any of our incorrect and extreme responses. You can do this in SPSS by clicking on the main menu Data \\> Select Cases. You then need to select ‘if condition is satisfied’ and click on the ‘if’. We can drag correct into the white box, and make sure it says ‘correct = 1’. This means that we only want cases which has the value 1, indicating a correct response. We also want to exclude our extreme responses, so write ‘& extreme_responses = 0’. This means we only want to include responses within our boundary. It should now say ‘correct = 1 & extreme_responses = 0’. The window should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image34.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click Continue and then OK, and any responses not meeting our criteria will be crossed out. For my data, there are four cases that are either incorrect or considered extreme. When we run any analyses, this will not be included but does not delete them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the outcome variable\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the average response for our two conditions, we can click on Analyze \\> Descriptive Statistics \\> Explore. Drag response_time into Dependent List and congruent into Factor List. Select Statistics under Display. The window should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image39.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Press OK to produce the output. This will provide the descriptive statistics split by the congruent variable. For the average, we will look at the median response time. Response times tend not to be normally distributed and the mean is often not an appropriate choice. Although it is not perfect, the median is a better choice than the mean in the presence of a skewed distribution with outliers (see Ratcliff, 1993 for a technical paper on dealing with response time outliers). For my data, my median response is 668ms when the colour and word are congruent, and 787ms when they are incongruent. This shows that even in 28 (excluding the four removed) trials you can see the Stroop interference effect. For a real experiment, it would be better to include many more trials as you will get a more accurate estimate, but this is fine for demonstration purposes. If this was entered in SPSS to analyse the data for each participant in an experiment, you would need the variables organised something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| participant | congruent_rt | incongruent_rt |\n",
    "|-------------|--------------|----------------|\n",
    "| 1           | 668          | 787            |\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, you have also seen how it is good to think in advance how you will analyse the data. This last section is one of the most important tips when designing experiments. Design it with the analysis in mind. It is better to realise now that you have overlooked something than when you have already collected data from 20 participants. You will find that you are testing your experiments out several times before the participants in order to catch any mistakes in creating the experiment, and to ensure you have all the variables you need to analyse the data when you have finished.\n"

    "The Stroop task is probably the most famous task in the whole of psychology. Without knowing the specific details, you might be able to have a go at creating a version of it yourself. However, what would you do if you came across an unfamiliar task that was described in a study you want to extend or replicate?\n",

    "## How do you recreate a psychology experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of learning how to use OpenSesame is to enable you to create psychology experiments that you can use in your research. However, what kind of experiments can you create and where do you find out how to create them? In all empirical psychology articles, there will be a method section outlining how the authors conducted their study. If this is written well enough, it should allow you to recreate their study as close as possible. In a lot of studies that use behavioural tasks, the authors provide diagrams of how their tasks are designed. The following diagram is from an EEG study by Rass et al. (2012).\n"

    "In the second part of this section, we will create the task on the top which is called the Eriksen Flanker task. This follows a similar principle to the Stroop task as it aims to measure the impact of interference on task performance. However, instead of looking at word colour, it uses distracting information. The aim of the task is to identify the middle letter in a five letter string. The four outer letters are distractors, and on some trials they are congruent, and on others they are incongruent. Studies usually find that response times are slower in the incongruent condition than the congruent condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the structure of each trial?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through the diagram above step by step in order to decode how it is designed. In this experiment a trial consists of a central fixation cross which stays on the screen for a random interval between 150-250ms. This randomness is usually introduced to stop participants just mindlessly clicking buttons to predictable stimuli. A stimulus then appears on the screen for 80ms. This period is sometimes called the Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA), or for how long the stimuli remain on the screen. There are two conditions for the stimuli: congruent (HHHHH or SSSSS) or incongruent (SSHSS or HHSHH). For this task, the participant has to identify the middle letter by pressing either the letter ‘s’ or ‘h’ on the keyboard. After the stimulus has disappeared, there is a blank screen where the participant has up to 800ms to provide a response. After the response, a blank screen is presented for 300ms. The participant is then provided feedback to let them know whether they pressed the correct button or not. A ‘+’ is shown for a correct response and a ‘-’ is shown for an incorrect response. Finally, an inter-trial interval (ITI; although confusingly this is called an inter-stimulus interval despite indicating the end of a trial) is shown on the screen for 500ms to indicate the end of a trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is the whole experiment organised?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how one trial is structured, we can see how many times this is repeated to form a block of trials. In the method section, there are more details about how many trials are included. In order for the participants to understand they are completing the task accurately, they are provided with 20 trials in a practice block. The authors then explain that participants completed four blocks each containing 100 trials for a total of 400 trials. Between each block there is a rest period for the participant, but it does not say how long this period is. We will provide participants with a short 30 second break. Finally, we know that there are an equal number of congruent and incongruent stimuli in each block. As we have two types of congruent and incongruent stimuli, we can take a good guess that each one of these is presented 25 times in each block. The authors provide us with a diagram of each trial, but we can visualise the structure of the whole experiment like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image80.png)\n",
    "This is the amount of information you need from an article to enable you to recreate the task the authors used. This is a particularly good example with the only missing information being the duration of the breaks, a relatively minor detail. You should be prepared to come across substantially less helpful authors that do not provide sufficient details. This is usually the case when it comes to tasks that use images. These are not normally shared or even described. Hopefully this will also demonstrate the importance of fully describing your experiment in a report or dissertation. Try and imagine you are the other researcher trying to recreate the task from your instructions. Now that we know how the task is designed, the next step is to recreate it in OpenSesame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the Eriksen Flanker Task in OpenSesame\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment, we will use the extended template rather than the default. This provides a helpful starting point by creating the basic outline of an experiment. This includes: instructions, a practice block, an experimental block, and an end of experiment message. The template should look like this when you first open it:\n",

Start off by changing the name of the experiment by clicking on Extended template in the overview, and changing the name to Eriksen Flanker task by clicking on Extended template in blue. We then want to change the text size to 32, and enter your monitor’s resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we made the Stroop task, we only included one block of trials as it was intended to provide a short introduction to creating an experiment using OpenSesame. However, when you create a real experiment, it is a good idea to create a practice block to ensure the participant fully understands what they are doing. One of the helpful features in OpenSesame is the ability to copy and paste a linked component. This means that they are joined, and if you change one of the components, both of them change. This can save a lot of time if the same components are being used with the same settings. In the extended template, the two outer loops (practice_loop and experimental_loop) are independent, but all the components inside them are linked. When you provide people with practice trials, they are usually much shorter than the real experiment as is the case with the design of Rass et al. (2012). Therefore, we are going to delete experimental_loop and edit practice_loop. When we have finished editing practice_loop, we will copy and paste an unlinked version to create another experimental_loop. Right click to delete experimental_loop, and make sure you select permanently delete. If you just click delete, the components will be available in Unused items and it will mess up naming them later.

    "### Editing the fixation dot\n",
    "\n",
    "In trial\\_sequence, there is helpfully a sketchpad component that already includes a fixation dot called sketchpad. Rename this component to fixation. In the trial diagram, fixation is displayed for a random interval between 150ms and 250ms. In the Stroop task, we just set a static duration for 500ms. To create a variable duration, we will need to use our first bit of real Python code. Drag an inline\\_script component ![](images/image55.png) into trial_sequence and place it before fixation. This component allows you to write Python code that can be used in your experiment. Rename it fix_duration as it will control how long our fixation dot is presented for. Within an inline script component, there are two tabs: Prepare and Run. The difference is not important here as we will only be creating a random number. However, if you were to create some complicated stimuli, it can take longer to prepare which affects the timing of the experiment. Therefore, it is better to prepare the stimuli in advance using the Prepare tab, and these can then be presented when necessary using the Run tab. For this example, we will just be writing two lines of code in the Prepare tab. On the first line, type:</p>"

OpenSesame uses the var object to access and create experimental variables in inline scripts. We use the equals sign to assign fix\\_duration with a number created by the second part of the code. The second part random.randint(150, 250) is accessing a function within the random library called randint. This creates a random integer (whole number) between two numbers which you specify. As we want a random duration between 150ms and 250ms, we enter 150 and 250. Therefore, at the start of every trial (as we put fix\\_duration within block\\_loop), we get a new random value for fix\\_duration. For example, on the first trial it could be 250, on the second 178, and so on. This discourages the participant from mindlessly responding in a predictable fashion.

If you click on trial_sequence, you will see a list of all the components within it. There is a second column called Run if. By default, this is set to always, so each component is displayed on every trial. We can modify this and use the correct variable that is updated on every trial. So if the participant pressed the correct button, this would be recorded as a 1, and if they pressed the wrong button, this would be recorded as a 0. Where it says always, change it to [correct] == 1 next to correct_response, and [correct] == 0 next to incorrect_response. The square brackets means we want to access a variable, and 1 and 0 refers to a correct or incorrect response. We two equals signs compares the values either side of the ==. If they match, it is evaluated as true, and if they do not, it is evaluated as false.

    "# Task three: Go-NoGo task with images\n",
    "====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "For the third task, we are going to create another commonly used cognitive task known as the Go-NoGo task. This measures inhibitory control, or the ability to stop a behaviour once you have started to make it. The standard version of the task presents a series of Go stimuli on the screen, for example a green circle or the letter ‘x’. Every time the participants sees the circle or letter they have to press a button on a keyboard. However, on a small number of trials (20% or fewer), a NoGo stimulus is presented, for example a red circle or the letter ‘o’. This time, they have to avoid pressing the button. Because of how fast the trials progress and the infrequency of the NoGo stimuli, it can be difficult to inhibit the response. The version of the task we are going to recreate is adapted to incorporate different types of images and is based on the task used in Dedandt et al. (2017). This will show you how you can incorporate images into your OpenSesame task.\n",

    "### Dedandt et al. (2017) were interested in comparing smokers and non-smokers on their ability to inhibit a response. They were also interested if different backgrounds would influence the smokers’ ability to inhibit a response. Therefore, three different backgrounds were used: a smoking cue, a non-smoking cue, and a neutral cue. If we look in the method section of Dedandt et al. (2017), there is a task diagram and a description of the task. We will go through the design of each trial, and how the whole task is structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the structure of one trial?\n",

    "\n",
    " ![](images/image63.png)\n",
    "We can see from the diagram that each trial begins with the presentation of the background for 500ms. In contrast to our two previous tasks, there does not appear to be a fixation cross/dot included in this task. A Go or NoGo cue is then presented on the screen for 200ms. On Go trials, this is a letter ‘M’ superimposed onto the background. On NoGo trials, this is the letter ‘W’. After the offset of the cue, there is a 1300ms period where the participant can make a response. The start of the next trial then begins with the next 500ms screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the structure of the whole experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the structure of the whole task, the study explains there are six experimental blocks. There were five backgrounds used in the task, two smoking images, two non-smoking images, and a blank black background. In contrast to Rass et al. (2012) in the last section, there is quite a bit of missing information that we would need to fully reproduce the task. First, there is no mention of a practice block. Second, the study does not explain that the same black background is used in two blocks. Third, it is not directly explained that one background is shown per block. You can work it out from the introduction and other information in the methods section, but it is not directly specified. These details can be found in another paper which the methodology is based on (Petit et al. 2012). This is a common occurrence, as research teams often produce several publications based on the same method, but to prevent repeating the details in each article, they just reference the first. Finally, it does not explain what kind of break was provided to the participants in between each block. We will give people 30 seconds in order to rest their eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we are trying to recreate the task from Dedandt et al. (2017), there is one feature we are going to consciously change: the proportion of Go and NoGo trials. In order to measure inhibitory control, the response to Go stimuli should be be prepotent, meaning you should want to quickly respond, in comparison to the NoGo trials. A long list of studies have been criticised for having too many NoGo trials (Wessel 2017; for a graphical explanation, see [FlexibleMeasures](http://www.flexiblemeasures.com/nogo/)). Therefore, Go-NoGo tasks should have a maximum of 20% NoGo trials. As Dedandt et al. (2017) had 30% of the trials as NoGo, we are going to tweak it slightly to be a more valid measure of inhibitory control. Therefore, instead of including 93 Go and 40 NoGo trials per block, we will include 100 Go trials and 25 NoGo trials per block. Similar to the Eriksen Flanker task, we can visualise the structure of the whole experiment like this:\n",

    "This task will use images as the background in order to manipulate the type of cues the participant is viewing. If we want to use images in OpenSesame, we need to make them accessible. To do this, we need to add them to the file pool ![](images/image66.png), and click the small green add symbol. This will allow you to browse your computer and select the files.

The start of each trial is just the background which is presented for 500ms. For each block, the background will be an image we added to the file pool or a plain black screen. This means we need to insert an image ![](images/image56.png)element into the centre of the screen at coordinate 0,0. When you click where you want the image, you will be prompted to select an image from the file pool. Select any image as we will be changing it to a variable later.\n",

To save having to repeat the procedure for the last component, copy and paste an unlinked version of background after the first background, and rename it stimulus\\_response. This component should have a duration of 200ms. This will be the same screen, but with a response cue and black circle superimposed on the background image. First, select a circle element ![](images/image35.png) and make the necessary edits. The image element should look the same as in the previous step. The next element is the circle element. In the figure from Dedandt et al. (2017), we can see the circle is solid black. By default, the color of the circle is set to white and not filled (indicated by fill = 0). Change color to black, and fill to 1. Change the radius (r) to 19 as this just covers the size of the text. Now we need to edit the text element. Change color to yellow to be consistent with the original study, and change the text to [stim_letter]. This is short for stimulus letter and we are preempting another variable we will set in the loop. The script for stimulus_response should now look like this:\n",

We will be using keyboard\\_response to control the duration. In keyboard\\_response, change Correct response to \\[correct\\_resp\\], Allowed responses to ‘m’ as this is the only response we will need, and Timeout to 1300. The logger is already there, so these are all the components we need. We can now start to add in all the variables we have preempted into block\\_loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are three variables we need to change on a trial by trial basis. The first variable we want to define is not relevant for the experiment, but it will be helpful for data analysis later. Label the first variable trial\\_type and enter four rows of ‘go’ and one row of ‘nogo’. In the second column, type stim\\_letter to control which letter we are presenting. For each ‘go’ trial enter a capital ‘M’, and for the ‘nogo’ trial enter a capital ‘W’. Finally, create a third variable called correct\\_resp. For each ‘M’ in stim\\_letter, write a lowercase ‘m’. For the ‘nogo’ trial where we have a ‘W’, write ‘None’. As we are testing the participant’s ability to resist making a response on ‘nogo’ trials, the correct response should be nothing at all. This means we want keyboard\\_response to time out, which OpenSesame records for the response as ‘None’. Therefore, if we enter ‘None’ for correct\\_resp, we will get an accurate recording for correct responses and accuracy in the data file. These are all the variables we need to define in this loop component. The loop should look like this when you have finished:\n",

    "<h3 id=)Defining the background image in practice\\_loop\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you may be thinking where we will define the background image. We saw from Dedandt et al. (2017) that we want one image to be presented per block in order to display the same background for a long period of time. Therefore, we are going to define the background image in the outer loop called practice\\_loop. As this is the practice loop, we only want one block to let the participant try out the task and make sure they understand what they’re doing. The first variable should be practice, and this should be set to 1 to indicate true. The second variable should be ‘image’ and set to ‘F1.jpg’ in reference to one of the images we saved in the file pool. Finally, we need a variable called ‘cue\\_type’ with one row set to ‘neutral’. During the practice block, it is best to avoid using stimuli that will be in the experimental blocks as the participants may get used to it. We are only defining this image here as we need the image to exist in our file pool or the experiment will crash. However, as we are setting cue\\_type to ‘neutral’, the image will not display because of how we defined the show\\_if argument in the image elements. For the practice block, we will just present the participants with a blank black screen. The practice\\_loop component should now look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image61.png)\n",
    "### Test the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we can test the experiment to make sure it works in its current form. If everything has been defined correctly, you should be able to quick run the experiment ![](images/image71.png)and complete five trials. Remember you should avoid making a response when the letter ‘W’ appears.</p>\n",
    "### Creating the experimental\\_loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the task works in principle, we can scale it up to include experimental blocks and change the background image. Copy and paste an unlinked version of practice\\_loop and place it after end\\_of\\_practice. We do not need end\\_of\\_practice, so you can permanently delete it. The overview of your experiment should now look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image32.png)\n",
    "Rename practice_loop_1 to experimental_loop, and permanently delete logger_1. Copy and paste a linked version of logger in the place of logger_1 after keyboard_response_1. This will ensure we have a tidier data file.\n",

    "### Specifying the background images\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now edit experimental\\_loop to control the background image on each block. The first row should already be there from copying and pasting the loop. This can stay the same as we need one black background screen. All you need to change is practice to 0 as this is now the experimental loop. We will create five more blocks. The image column should have five more rows with F1.jpg, F1.jpg, F11.jpg, N1.jpg, and N11.jpg. For the first two instances of F1.jpg, cue\\_type should be ‘neutral’ to create two blocks with a black background. For the remaining images starting with ‘F’, cue\\_type should be ‘smoking’, and for the images starting with ‘N’, cue\\_type should be ‘nonsmoking’. All the rows should have a 0 for practice.

    "\n",
    "### Editing the instruction components\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can focus on tidying up the instructions. The first thing to change is instructions. Here you can edit the text and explain to prospective participants that they need to press the letter ‘m’ when they see an ‘M’, and withhold a response when they see a ‘W’. Remember for any text you are editing, you will need to change the font size to 32 manually by editing the script. In feedback, we need to explain to the participants that they will begin the experimental trials when they press a button. In feedback\\_1, we need to explain to the participants that they have a 30 second break. Make sure you change the duration to 30000. We now need to insert a new sketchpad component called end\\_of\\_break after feedback\\_1. Write a message explaining to participants that their break has finished and ensure they can start the next block with a keypress. Finally, change end\\_of\\_experiment to thank the participants for their time and they can exit the experiment by pressing any button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Controlling when the breaks are presented\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last experiment, we stopped feedback\\_1 and end\\_of\\_break from appearing after the final block. Each block was identical, so we just presented each block sequentially and used the number of the fourth block to stop the two components from appearing. However, this time it is not so simple. We cannot simply label each block 1 to 5 as they are being randomly presented. What we need is to label each block as we go along so the background is free to be randomly presented. We can do this by inserting two inline script components ![](images/image55.png)called block_count between reset_feedback_1 and block_loop_1 in experimental_loop. Here we need to write var.block = var.block + 1 in the prepare tab. For each loop around experimental_loop this assigns var.block to equal the previous value for block plus one. The positioning of these two inline script components is very important. We want block_start to be outside of experimental_loop as we do not want it to be reset to 0 on on each cycle around the loop. We also want block_count to be in experimental_group and not block_loop_1. If we placed it in block_loop_1, it would increase by one on each trial. We want it to increase by one on each block, so by the time we get to the fifth block, block will equal 5. This means that we can enter some short Python code into block_sequence_1 to control when feedback_1 and end_of_break are run. Where it says always, change it to [block] < 5 for feedback_1 and end_of_break. The block_sequence_1 component should now look like this:\n",

However, on nogo trials, the participants should not be pressing anything, which means the response time should always be 1300ms.

    "# Tips for Debugging Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging an experiment requires problem solving and can be considered a skill in itself. It is similar to the process of science. You have a hypothesis about a problem you are facing. You systematically test the sources of the problem until you isolate it, and then fix the problem. Most of this guide is based on using the OpenSesame GUI, and you will generally encounter fewer bugs than if you were to write your experiment using scripts. However, you will still encounter problems with implementing your ideas. Perhaps your images are not presenting how you want them to, or your feedback is not working. Solving these problems is very similar to solving problems in code. Some of this advice is taken from the excellent book on another Python based experiment builder called PsychoPy (Peirce and MacAskill, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to take when debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Read the error messages carefully. If your experiment crashes,    OpenSesame does its very best to tell you what caused the problem.    Take task three as an example. I run the experiment, and as soon    as I press a key after the instructions, the experiment closes and    I get the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](images/image16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenSesame provides us with a reason for the experiment crashing: thevariable “cuetype” does not exist. At this point, you realise youmissed the underscore and it should be “cue_type”. Not all of theproblems will be this easy, but you should be directed by OpenSesameto the simple fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look for typos carefully. In my own experience, a stray typo is one of the most common causes of an experiment crashing. As Python is case sensitive, it can be difficult to spot the difference between image and Image. Likewise, the difference between colour and color may be hard to spot. If you are struggling to find typos, you may just be too tired. Make sure you take frequent breaks to prevent being fatigued.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test your experiments in a separate window. When testing your experiments, always run it in a separate window until you know it works. If you run your experiment full-screen, you may have made a mistake that causes it to freeze and you will be unable to escape it. At best, you just have to restart your computer. At worst, you may have lost an hour’s worth of work if you did not save it beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Be methodical. If you do not know the source of the problem immediately, change one thing at a time until the experiment works. In an ideal world, get into the habit of testing your experiment after every addition. This means you should know which addition caused the problem in the first place. You can then investigate what it is about that addition that caused the problems.\n"

    "## Asking for help\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this guide is to provide you with support to create experiments on your own. However, there will be times where you do not know how to put your idea into practice, or you cannot figure out what is wrong with your experiment. If you are asking for help, the person you are asking will not be very happy if you just say “it doesn’t work”. They will be very grateful if you can break it down and say “I have tried these steps, but it does not work”, or “I have narrowed it down to X, but I cannot work out what is wrong with it”. In my experience, the act of writing down the steps you have taken to solve the problem can often lead you to the solution yourself as you see the bigger picture."
