        "feedback": "Correct answer. Combined with the disabled option Evaluate on first cycle, each time the loop is run it will only present one trial. Because Resume after break is enabled it will remember the history of samples and the order is preserved"

        "feedback": "Incorrect answer. In this case the loop is already aborted before it can run a trial, so it will not show anything. Try it yourself!"
