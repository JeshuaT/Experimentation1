    "\n",
    "The Cyberball game allows psychologists to investigate the effects of social exclu- sion (ostracism). Kipling D. Williams came up with this idea after a Frisbee rolled up and hit him in the back when relaxing in a park in 1983:\n",
    "\n",
    "> He turned around, saw two other guys looking at him expectantly, and threw the Frisbee back to them. He was a bit surprised when they threw the disk back to him; he walked toward them to form a triangle, and threw it back again. For about a minute, the three of them threw the Frisbee around in a spirited game of catch. What happened next sparked an idea as to how to study the effects of ostracism. For no apparent reason, the two original players started throwing the Frisbee only to each other, and never threw it to the newcomer again. After sheepishly back-stepping toward his dog, the author was amazed at how bad he felt. He was sad, embarrassed, and a bit angry. He wondered what he had done to warrant being ostracised by the other two players. He sought comfort from his faithful dog. Then, it occurred to him that something like this, adapted for the laboratory, would be an excellent means to study ostracism and social exclusion. (Williams & Jarvis, 2006, p.174).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the instructions participants usually receive:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Welcome to Cyberball, the Interactive Ball-Tossing Game Used for Mental Visualisation!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In the upcoming experiment, we test the effects of practising mental visualisation on task performance. Thus, we need you to practise your mental visualisation skills. We have found that the best way to do this is to have you play an on-line game of catch with other participants who are logged on at the same time.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In a few moments, you will be playing a game of catch with other students over our network. The game is very simple. When the ball is tossed to you, simply use the keyboard to indicate the player (with numerical key 1 or 3) you want to throw it to. When the game is over, the experimenter will give you additional instructions.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> What is important is not your ball tossing performance, but that you MENTALLY VISUALISE the entire experience. Imagine what the others look like. What sort of people are they? Where are you playing? Is it warm and sunny, or cold and rainy? Create in your mind a complete mental picture of what might be going on if you were playing this game in real life.\n",

    "### Step 1: Programming the basic experimental flow\n",
    "\n",
    "To program the game, you first need some movie clips that show a ball moving between the players. You need six of them depicting all possible directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "From player 1 to player 2 ([1to2.wmv](files/1to2.wmv))\\\n",
    "From player 1 to player 3 ([1to3.wmv](files/1to3.wmv))\\\n",
    "From player 2 to player 1 ([2to1.wmv](files/2to1.wmv))\\\n",
    "From player 2 to player 3 ([2to3.wmv](files/2to3.wmv))\\\n",
    "From player 3 to player 1 ([3to1.wmv](files/3to1.wmv))\\\n",
    "From player 3 to player 2 ([3to2.wmv](files/3to2.wmv))\n",
    "\n",
    "The six movie files can be downloaded using the links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these small Windows Media Files have been converted from the original animated gifs that are freely available on [K.D. Williams' website](http://www3.psych.purdue.edu/\\~willia55/Announce/cyberball.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's draw the basic flow chart for each trial, which determines which movies should be played when:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/WhoseTurnOS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This flow chart basically decides who is throwing the ball in this trial (Player 1, Player 2, or Player 3) and, by retrieving the values from a variable (column) from the OpenSesame Loop object (see next step), it will decide the destination of the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create the entire experiment from scratch and use the 'default template', which is already loaded when OpenSesame is launched. You can simple delete the 'Get started!' and copy paste the introduction described above in the `welcome` sketchpad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, make sure you download and add all six video files mentioned above to the File pool first. Also, set the back-end of the experiment to `legacy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any moment during the experiment we need to have access to the information about which player currently has the ball. So, create a new variable named `current_player` with the initial value 1, in a new inline_script called `init_exp` at the beginning of your `experiment` procedure (the game always starts with Player 1 throwing the ball). As shown here:"

    "Let's now think about how to set up the `player1_loop` and `player2_loop`. These loops should retrieve the new destination that the virtual Players 1 and 3 will toss the ball to. So add a variable (column) in boths loops named `target_player` and type in the possible destinations of that player (a player is not allowed to toss the ball to themselves! It would be an interesting extension of the paradigm, though...).\n",

    "#### 1. Dummy loop solution\n",
    "Open the old experiment with the media_player you saved after Step 3. Replace the `media_player_mpy` with a dummy_loop that runs the media_player_mpy object. Add the column `my_movie_filename` to the dummy_loop and enter the value `[movie_filename]` in the first row. Change the Video file field of media_player_mpy to [my_movie_filename]. Remove any reference to the items.prepare() command in all inlines. Because the prepare-run strategy is repeated for each loop separately, the movie is updated automatically at the end of the trial. Try whether this solution works.\n",
    "#### 2. Run-If solution\n",
    "Because we have a limited number of videos to present (six combinations) it might be more elegant to preload all relevant movies in the beginning of the trial and use the Run If feature to only present the video that shows the correct target_player.  Open the old experiment with the media_player you saved after Step 3. Remove any reference to the items.prepare() command in all inlines. Use two media_players per trial with fixed filenames. Run only the relevant video depending on the value of target_player using the Run if feature in the `play1_seq`, `play2_seq`, and `play3_seq` sequences."
