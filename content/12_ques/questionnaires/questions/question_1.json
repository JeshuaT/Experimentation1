        "correct": true,
        "feedback": "Correct! In this case it fills the content of variable i with zeros until 2 numbers are reached. So 1 becomes 01, 2 becomes 02 etc. When i equals 10, no zero is added because that value already consists of two characters. Numbers with preceding zeros also sort easier as strings (e.g. 001,002,003...,009,010,099,100) instead of the default (1,10,100,2,3,4,5,6... ) so use it frequently!"
