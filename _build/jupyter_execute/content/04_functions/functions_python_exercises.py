# ### Exercise 1. Sequence of function calls
# 
# What will the following Python program print out?
# 
# ```
# def fred():
#    print("Zap")
# 
# def jane():
#    print("ABC")
# 
# jane()
# fred()
# jane()
# ```
# 
# a) Zap ABC jane fred jane
# b) Zap ABC Zap
# c) ABC Zap jane
# d) ABC Zap ABC
# e) Zap Zap Zap
# 
# Check your answer by running the code
# 
# ### Exercise 2. Pay computation with a function
# 
# Rewrite your pay computation with time-and-a-half for overtime and create a function called computepay which takes two parameters (hours and rate).
# 
# ```
# Enter Hours: 45
# Enter Rate: 10
# Pay: 475.0
# ```
# 
# ### Exercise 3. Grade calculation using a function
# 
# Rewrite the grade program from the previous session using a function called computegrade that takes a score as its parameter and returns a grade as a string.
# 
#  Score   Grade
# \>= 0.9     A
# \>= 0.8     B
# \>= 0.7     C
# \>= 0.6     D
#  < 0.6     F
# 
# ```
# Enter score: 0.95
# A
# Enter score: perfect
# Bad score
# Enter score: 10.0
# Bad score
# Enter score: 0.75
# C
# Enter score: 0.5
# F
# ```
# 
# Run the program repeatedly to test the various different values for input.
# 
# ### Exercise 4. Check age of your participant
# 
# Rewrite the check age program from the previous session using a function that takes the age and the name and returns the message as a string.
#
