# ### Exercise 3. Grade calculation using a function
# 
# Rewrite the grade program from the previous chapter using a function called computegrade that takes a score as its parameter and returns a grade as a string.
# 
#  Score   Grade
# \>= 0.9     A
# \>= 0.8     B
# \>= 0.7     C
# \>= 0.6     D
#  < 0.6     F
# 
# ```
# Enter score: 0.95
# A
# Enter score: perfect
# Bad score
# Enter score: 10.0
# Bad score
# Enter score: 0.75
# C
# Enter score: 0.5
# F
# ```
# 
# Run the program repeatedly to test the various different values for input.
