# 
# 
# Exercise 2: Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them.
# 
# Enter your name: Chuck
# Hello Chuck
# 
# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.
# 
# Enter Hours: 35
# Enter Rate: 2.75
# Pay: 96.25
# We wonâ€™t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.
# 
# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
# 
# width = 17
# height = 12.0
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).
# 
# width//2
# 
# width/2.0
# 
# height/3
# 
# 1 + 2 * 5
# 
# Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.
# 
# Exercise 5: Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature.
