# ### Exercise 2. Create a animated countdown timer
# Adapt he pokeball in such a way that you create an animated countdown timer that counts from 30 to 0 seconds and shows a red arc that become smaller with time.
# 
# > **Hint** The easiest solution is to present a loop that runs 30 times, updates the arc and text and then waits 1 second (let's ignore for now that the canvas operations also take time so the timer might be slightly inaccurate)

# Ask the user how many seconds they want to wait and run the timer with this value. Check whether the value is not higher than fits in the display (99m:59s).
