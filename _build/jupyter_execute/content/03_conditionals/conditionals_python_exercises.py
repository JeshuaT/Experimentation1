# ### Exercise 1. Advanced pay computation (1)
# 
# Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.

# ```
# Enter Hours: 45
# Enter Rate: 10
# Pay: 475.0
# ```

# ### Exercise 2. Advanced pay computation (2)
# 
# Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. The following shows two executions of the program:
# 
# ```
# Enter Hours: 20
# Enter Rate: nine
# Error, please enter numeric input
# Enter Hours: forty
# Error, please enter numeric input
# ```

# ### Exercise 3. Convert scores to grades
# 
# Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
# 
#  Score   Grade
# \>= 0.9     A
# \>= 0.8     B
# \>= 0.7     C
# \>= 0.6     D
#  < 0.6     F
# ```
# Enter score: 0.95
# A
# Enter score: perfect
# Bad score
# Enter score: 10.0
# Bad score
# Enter score: 0.75
# C
# Enter score: 0.5
# F
# ```
# 
# Run the program repeatedly as shown above to test the various different values for input.

# ### Exercise 4. Check the age of your participant
# 
# Write a program to prompt a user for their name and age. If the person is younger than 18 provide a message that the person is too young. If the person is older than 30 provides a message that the person is too old. If the value is between 18 and 30, provide a personalized welcome message, that says "Hello xx, welcome to this experiment." (replace the xx).
