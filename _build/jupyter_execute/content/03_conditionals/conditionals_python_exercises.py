# 
# Exercise 1: Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.
# 
# Enter Hours: 45
# Enter Rate: 10
# Pay: 475.0
# Exercise 2: Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. The following shows two executions of the program:
# 
# Enter Hours: 20
# Enter Rate: nine
# Error, please enter numeric input
# Enter Hours: forty
# Error, please enter numeric input
# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
# 
#  Score   Grade
# >= 0.9     A
# >= 0.8     B
# >= 0.7     C
# >= 0.6     D
#  < 0.6     F
# Enter score: 0.95
# A
# Enter score: perfect
# Bad score
# Enter score: 10.0
# Bad score
# Enter score: 0.75
# C
# Enter score: 0.5
# F
# Run the program repeatedly as shown above to test the various different values for input.
