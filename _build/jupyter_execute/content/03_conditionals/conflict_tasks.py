# ## Exercises
# 
# ### Excercise 0. Change the number of trials
# refer to Brysbaert
# 
# ### Excercise 1. Stop practice block when performance is sufficient
# 
# Open the flanker task you created earlier in OpenSesame. Change the number of trials in the practice phase to 100. Create a script that counts the number of practice trials. Stop the practice block if at least 10 trials have been presented and the accuracy is at least 80%. Abort the experiment if this criterion is still not met after 100 trials.
# 
# ### Excercise 2. Calculate average correct reaction time
# Only correct reaction times.
# 
# ### Excercise 3. Counterbalancing: Even or odd participant number
# 
# TODO elif!
