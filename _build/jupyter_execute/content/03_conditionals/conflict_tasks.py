# # Stroop and flanker tasks

# Open the flanker task you created earlier in OpenSesame. Change the number of trials in the practice phase to 100. Create a script that counts the number of practice trials. Stop the practice block if at least 10 trials have been presented and the accuracy is at least 80%. Abort the experiment if this criterion is still not met after 100 trials.
