    "We will be making use of the experiment builder [OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.3/). The advantage of this experiment builder is that it allows you to build experiment using both a [graphical user interface (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) and the programming language [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). To download OpenSesame, navigate to the [download page](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.3/download/) and choose the right installation for your operating system. For Windows, the standard download suffices."

For example, [Expyriment](https://www.expyriment.org/) is more lightweight than other experiment builders, but you should be comfortable with only coding. [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/) is a good alternative for OpenSesame, but also requires a bit more coding proficiency. This course used to be taught in [E-prime](https://pstnet.com/products/e-prime/), which is (paid) software with its own coding language specifically tailored for building experiments."

    "## Anaconda\n",
    "Installing [Anaconda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(Python_distribution)) is a very convenient way to get started with programming in Python if you are a psychologist/neuroscientist. If you don't have any prior programming experience, we suggest you download the latest version of Anaconda via [this link](https://www.anaconda.com/). You can view Anaconda as a kind of starter pack for doing data-science in Python: it installs not only Python for you, but also all kinds of packages (add-ons) and software that you will most certainly use as a scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: A disadvantage of Anaconda is that it also installs a lot of packages/software that you will perhaps never use. Therefore, if you already have experience with programming, a good alternative is [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which gives you all the functionality of Anaconda without the extra packages/software."

    "## Python IDE\n",
    "Just as you type words to make essays in either Word, Pages or Notepad, you can also have different software programs in which you can type Python code to make Python scripts. We call those software programs *integrated development environments (IDEs)*. Conveniently, your Anaconda installation comes with one such IDE: [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). Just as Word and Pages have all kind of tools to help you write essays, Spyder comes with all kinds of tools to help you write Python code. However, just as you had to practice with Word to make the best use of the tool, so it is that you'll need practice to make the best use of Spyder. So lets start right away with making your first script!\n",
