    "\n",
    "It is often convenient to have markers that indicate the start and the end of each block of trials, for example if you want to exclude EEG or other physiological data collected during the breaks when analyzing your data. Add the markers 101 and 102 to indicate the start and the end of the practice block, respectively. Add the markers 111 and 112 for test block 1, 121 and 122 for test block 2, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's think a moment about the length of the markers. How long do you present the markers before the signals goes back to 0? And how long does the signal stays 0 before you send a new marker? Make sure there is sufficient time between the onset of the start-block marker and the first stimulus marker of a block. Also make sure there is sufficient time after the end of the last trial and the onset of the end-block marker. What is the minimum duration of the marker and the period it is 0 when the device that records your parallel port signal samples at 500 Hz (i.e. 500 read-outs per second)? And what is the minimum duration when the sample frequency is 50 Hz?\n",

    "We will use the 8 LEDs displayed on the parallel port test device kindly provided by our lab support department. In our case the scanner beam is actually a light which starts at the left and, when it reaches the right, goes back towards the left. The easiest example to implement is the one with one light only, but if you really want to test your skills you could instead start with two lights which then move two steps to the right, ending with two lights on the right before moving back. Both examples are illustrated in the figure below.\n",
