# 
# ### Exercise 1. Print content of text file line by line
# Write a program to read through a file and print the contents of the file (line by line) all in upper case. Executing the program will look as follows:
# 
# ```
# Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt

# ### Exercise 2. Parsing content of a text file
# 
# Write a program to prompt for a file name, and then read through the file and look for lines of the form:
# 
# X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475
# When you encounter a line that starts with “X-DSPAM-Confidence:” pull apart the line to extract the floating-point number on the line. Count these lines and then compute the total of the spam confidence values from these lines. When you reach the end of the file, print out the average spam confidence.
# 
# ```
# Enter the file name: mbox.txt
# Average spam confidence: 0.894128046745
# 
# Enter the file name: mbox-short.txt
# Average spam confidence: 0.750718518519
# ```
# Test your file on the [mbox.txt](https://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt) and [mbox-short.txt](www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt) files.

# ### Exercise 3. Add an Easter Egg
# The following code was provided in the [material belonging to today's python for everyone lesson](https://www.py4e.com/html3/07-files):

# In[ ]:


```
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
fhand = open(fname)
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)

# Code: http://www.py4e.com/code3/search6.py
```


# Sometimes when programmers get bored or want to have a bit of fun, they add a harmless Easter Egg to their program. Modify the code above that prompts the user for the file name so that it prints a funny message when the user types in the exact file name “na na boo boo”. The program should behave normally for all other files which exist and don’t exist. Here are three sample of the expected behavior when executing your code
# 
# ```
# Enter the file name: mbox.txt
# There were 1797 subject lines in mbox.txt
# 
# Enter the file name: missing.tyxt
# File cannot be opened: missing.tyxt
# 
# Enter the file name: na na boo boo
# NA NA BOO BOO TO YOU - You have been punk'd!
# ```
# 
# We are not encouraging you to put Easter Eggs in your programs; this is just an exercise.

# ### Exercise 4. Read files until you are done
# 
# Add an outer loop to the code in exercise 3 that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a file name until they type 'Done' (case insensitive). Within the loop, the existing code should execute for each file name entered.
