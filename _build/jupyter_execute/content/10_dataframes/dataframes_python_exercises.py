# # Python exercises: Dataframes

# ## Exercise 1: Dataframe wrangling

# In the lessons you followed along an explanation using a open dataset with information on salary.  Below is the code to get you on your way.
# 
# A dataset we recommend exploring is the [dataset on global CO2 and greenhouse emission](https://github.com/owid/co2-data). However, you are free to choose any dataset you find interesting.

# In[ ]:


import pandas as pd

# Change the link below to whatever csv you want to load in
df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')


# ## BONUS Exercise 2: Real-world problems

# There are many more publicly available datasets you can directly use. For this exercise, you can choose a dataset you find interesting. The website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) has datasets on the most pressing world-problems, now you are learning the tools how to work with these datasets! Pretty cool right. In your own Python IDE, choose and download a dataset you find interesting (search for the .csv file) and replicate each step from the [the tutorial](http://teaching.gureckislab.org/fall22/labincp/chapters/05/00-data.html), starting from subchapter 6.6.

# In[ ]:


import pandas as pd

# Change the link below to whatever csv you want to load in
df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')
