# # Python exercises: Plotting

# During the exercises in the dataframes module you learned how to import a dataset, and how to look at the dataframe from multiple angles. In the python lessons for this module you learned that you can use matplotlib in three different ways. From "quick-and-rigid" to "slow-but-flexible", these are:
# (1) Seaborn plotting
# (2) Pyplot procedural plotting
# (3) Object-oriented plotting
# 
# ## Exercise 1
# Pick a dataset whereby something changes over time (e.g. the [dataset on global CO2 and greenhouse emission](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)). Using a seaborn lineplot, plot the change over time. Add a title, an x-label, a y-label and a legend (if suitable).

# ## Exercise 2
# Now, make the same plot using the pyplot procedural plotting approach.

# ## Exercise 3
# Yes, you guessed it: now plot the same plot using the object-oriented approach
