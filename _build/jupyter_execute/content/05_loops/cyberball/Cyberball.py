# The Cyberball game allows psychologists to investigate the effects of social exclu- sion (ostracism). Kipling D. Williams came up with this idea after a Frisbee rolled up and hit him in the back when relaxing in a park in 1983:
# 
# > He turned around, saw two other guys looking at him expectantly, and threw the Frisbee back to them. He was a bit surprised when they threw the disk back to him; he walked toward them to form a triangle, and threw it back again. For about a minute, the three of them threw the Frisbee around in a spirited game of catch. What happened next sparked an idea as to how to study the effects of ostracism. For no apparent reason, the two original players started throwing the Frisbee only to each other, and never threw it to the newcomer again. After sheep- ishly back-stepping toward his dog, the author was amazed at how bad he felt. He was sad, embarrassed, and a bit angry. He wondered what he had done to warrant being ostracised by the other two players. He sought comfort from his faithful dog. Then, it occurred to him that something like this, adapted for the laboratory, would be an excellent means to study ostracism and social exclusion. (Williams & Jarvis, 2006, p.174).

# These are the instructions participants usually receive:
# 
# > "Welcome to Cyberball, the Interactive Ball-Tossing Game Used for Mental Visualisation!
# >
# > In the upcoming experiment, we test the effects of practising mental visualisation on task performance. Thus, we need you to practise your mental visualisation skills. We have found that the best way to do this is to have you play an on-line game of catch with other participants who are logged on at the same time.
# >
# > In a few moments, you will be playing a game of catch with other students over our network. The game is very simple. When the ball is tossed to you, simply use the keyboard to indicate the player (with numerical key 1 or 3) you want to throw it to. When the game is over, the experimenter will give you additional instructions.
# >
# > What is important is not your ball tossing performance, but that you MENTALLY VISUALISE the entire experience. Imagine what the others look like. What sort of people are they? Where are you playing? Is it warm and sunny, or cold and rainy? Create in your mind a complete mental picture of what might be going on if you were playing this game in real life.
