    "# Merging logfiles OpenSesame\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Warning** During this tutorial we are going to work with files. You learn to create, copy, move, and delete files! Make sure you run your scripts in a location where you are allowed to edit files and that this location does not contain other files. Be careful and make sure you do not accidentially delete or move other files (copying is safer then moving or deleting!). Make backups of important files on your computer before continuing. The sandbox of Google Colab is a safe (more protected) environment to work with files.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "OpenSesame creates a logfile separately for each participant you run. In this tutorial we show a way to merge these logfiles by assuming they all have exactly the same format (i.e., they have identical headers). This is not necessarily the case if you run slightly different versions of the experiment for different participants! Note that during the datawrangling tutorial in a later chapter, you will learn about a different way to merge logfiles that is more flexible.\n",
