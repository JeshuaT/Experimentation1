    "### Exercise 1. Convert a binary number to a decimal number\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a binary number to a decimal value you can use the int function as shown in the example below. Write python code that converts an 8-bit binary number (provided  by the user as a string of eight zeros and ones) to a decimal value and print this value using a loop. Check the result by comparing the value to the table provided in today's lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hint** To convert an 8-bit binary number to a decimal value, first assign each bit a weight based on its position in the binary number. The rightmost bit, or least significant bit, has a weight of 1, the next bit to the left has a weight of 2, the next bit has a weight of 4, and so on.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Next, determine the decimal value of each bit by multiplying its weight by its value (1 for a 1 and 0 for a 0). For example, if the binary number is 11011011, the decimal value of the rightmost bit is 1 (1 * 2^0), the decimal value of the next bit is 2 (1 * 2^1), the decimal value of the next bit is 0 (0 * 2^2), and so on.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Finally, add up the decimal values of each bit to find the total decimal value of the binary number. In the example above, the total decimal value is 128 + 64 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 219.\n"
